Some shop owner decides to convert an old-abandoned place in a Haberdashery.  He wants visual solutions and interior planning for the new site.

The main challenge was to adapt the idea of a shop store to a non-conventional space, with a lot of curves and sewing elements. Also, the final solution needed to provoke and like the customers. The ultimate solution brought a combination of colors and lights. Besides, we used the inside curves to simulate the softness of the cloth materials, and to indicate paths inside the store.
