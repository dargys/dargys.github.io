The Design career in Cuba takes five years and usually finish with a thesis work. The primary motivation was to provide a solution for furniture in City Hotels, saving space and resources. The problem was formulated by [DUJO](https://www.facebook.com/arteycomodidad/), a furniture enterprise in Cuba.


The research stage included material experimentation, measurements, the application of official anthropometry, and the fitting for local implementation of the solutions. The final result was two morphological unit solutions, which allows the client (DUJO) to save space.
