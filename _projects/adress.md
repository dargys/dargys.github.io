This was my first incursion in sustainable development. The main idea was to create fashion with non recyclable materials, making them recyclable. I created this dress using plastic bags and waste.



It was shown in a Fashion Show in [FAC](http://www.fac.cu/), this place was recently tagged as a world cultural destination site.
